            There's tons of great party games â€” but unlike the rest, Box ONE is designed to challenge just ONE person: YOU! And you alone.
                
            Prepare to set out on an exciting adventure like no other as you discover, decode, and unlock the secrets of Box ONE.
                
            Look closely, though, as with all things - there's more than meets the eye...
                
            Box ONE is the perfect gift for anyone into puzzles, codes, and escape rooms. The game represents years of thought and careful planning by Neil Patrick Harris. Everything you need to decode each challenge is inside the box. Can you decode it? Can you solve it? The clock is ticking...

                Excellent Game! I could not have been more impressed with the creativity involved in the creation of this story line. I also absolutely loved the integration of technology into what I expected to be a "board game." Had a few issues with the website and it loading properly, however, that does not take away from a hands down 5 star game. I NEED ANOTHER NEIL, PLEASE!</p>
