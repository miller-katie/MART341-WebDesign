    <h2><u>Inflatable Boards</u></h2>
    <div class="description">
        <img class="inflatable" src="../images/inflatable.jpeg">
        <p> Inflatable SUPs feature PVC exteriors with drop-stitch construction that create an air core. They come with a pump for inflating the board and a storage bag for when it's not in use. A quality inflatable SUP is designed to be inflated to 12-15 pounds per square inch and should feel very rigid when fully inflated. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pro1">
        <h2 align="center"> Pros</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Compact and great for travel</li>
            <li>Softer decks reduce fatique</li>
            <li>Typically cheaper than a solid board</li>
            <li>Can be checked on airplanes</li>
            <li>Falls hurt less</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="con1">
        <h2 align="center">Cons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Not as slick thorugh water as a fiberglass board</li>
            <li> Flexing in the middle of the board can occur</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    </br>
    </br>
    <h2 class="head"><u>Solid Boards</u></h2>
    <div class="description">
        <img class="solid" src="../images/Solid.jpeg">
        <p>Hard boards are typically made using an EPS foam core that is wrapped in layers of fiberglass with an epoxy resin coating. Several layers are used and carbon fiber is often chosen for rails to give extra strength, durability, and a lightweight finish. Hard SUPs cut through the water and glide
        with ease. They tend to have sensitive control making them ideal for SUP surfing and maneruvering on waves. There is little drag from materials so, shape allowing, these boards can gain a lot of speed as well. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pro2">
        <h2 align="center"> Pros</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Better stability than inflatables due to rigid construction</li>
            <li>Faster speeds in water and easier maneruvering</li>
            <li>Durable</li>
            <li>Time saving, as they are always ready to go and do not have to be set up</li>
            <li>Always firm enough with no flexing</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="con2">
        <h2 align="center">Cons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy and Bulky</li>
            <li> Requires large and proper storage space</li>
            <li>Hard to transport</li>
            <li>Not great for traveling to other lakes outside of your home town</li>
            <li>Typically more expensive than an inflatable board</li>
        </ul>
