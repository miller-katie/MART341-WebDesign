    <h1> Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
    <div class="p">
        <h2>Where can I paddleboard?</h2>
        <p> You can take your board to just about any public body of water! Purchasing an inflatable board is really key for maximum flexibility in locations. Oftentimes there are many incrediable places to board right in your backyard. P.S. Life jackets, do not have to be worn, but are required in most states to be on the board and avaliable at all times.  </p>

        <h2>What weather is best?</h2>
        <p> Paddleboarding is best done on warmer sunny days. Though clouds in the sky should not steer you away either. Cloudy days and cooler weather can make for a nice day on the water as well if you aren't wanting to burn or sweat. <b>DO NOT</b> go out if there is storms, rain, or high winds. The windy.com app is a great place to check for winds.

        <h2>How do I find locations?</h2>
        <p>The best way to find specific spots to put your boards in is through the FREE app called GoPaddling. This app will show you well-known locations and recently found locations. All spots are put on the map from fellow paddle boarders and each spot will provide information for parking, where to launch, if you need permits, reviews on the location, and some spots even have photos! This is by far my favorite app and it is so easy to use.
