        <h3>A Brief History</h3>
        <p>Paddleboarding dates back thousands of years. Believed to have its roots in Africa, Polynesia, and South America. Experts theorize that even then, peopel were using paddling for both work and play. In 1778, explorer Captain James cook became the first European to discover the Hawiian Islands. It was there he discovered that local Polynesians lived to surf. The chief's board could be over 15 feet long and sometimes a paddle was used to navigate their board in the waves. The use of the paddle with thier surf boards makes the Polynsians the first modern day stand up paddle boarders currently known.</p>

        <h3>Where we are today</h3>
        <p>Paddleboarding as we know it today arrived in California in the early 2000's. At first it was only practiced by surfers for training but by 2005, the world was hooked! There are so many ways you can use your board - with kids, pets, frends, for working out, and workout classes. It is one of the more favorable alternatives to those that want to be on the water but can't surf or steer a canoe. Paddle Boarding is said to be one of the fastest-growing sports in the world. With the ease of inflatable paddleboards, this isn't giong to slow down anytime soon. It's estimated that, in 2023, roughly <b>4.13 million poeple</b> regularly participate in paddleboarding just in the U.S. alone. </p>
