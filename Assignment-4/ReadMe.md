**1. Explain how web browseres funciton**

This week we learned that web browsers have a lot of stuff going on in the background. Most of which happens so quickly that we don’t even notice it happening. Browsers use HTML, or similar writing languages, to create the interface we all interact with when it comes to specific websites. Browsers have what is called a rendering engine that reads the HTML to represent any content that we see. The rendering engine also reads CSS to create visuals. There is also a browser engine that works with a network and with the servers to be able to fetch websites as needed. One of the last key components is a script interpreter. Each browser has their own type of interpreter which is why some websites may look different on Safari vs Chrome. When you open a browser these different engines and interpreters work together to pull all the HTML, CSS, and other data from the backend to populate the website as an interactive and visual user interface, typically at lightning speed. 

**2. Define and describe DOM**

DOM stands for Document Object Model and it is a type of rendering agent for reading markup languages. The purpose of the DOM is to read HTML and create what is called a DOM tree. The DOM tree is made up of nodes that consist of elements that are meant to be displayed on the website being requested. A DOM creates the tree in a layout that corresponds with where each element will be placed on the website once it loads, but it is not a website in itself. Essentially, the DOM is going to create an easy-to-follow structure of the HTML with its tree. By making DOM trees and organizing content the DOM also assists scripts such as JAVA to modify content. Altogether this helps a website display properly. 

**3. What is the difference between HTML, XML, and XHTML?**

All three of these are types of markup languages. HTML however is the most common and most popular of the three. A large difference between HTML and XML is their ease of tagging. HTML has a tagging system in place that is universal whereas XML has no predefined tags and needs to be done manually. HTML will be best at displaying nodes in a webpage structure but due to XML’s use of plain text, it doesn’t render anything from a document. XHTML on the other hand is very close to HTML but is seen as a combo between HTML and XML. It takes the pros from each and attempts to limit the cons. However, because of this XHTML has high standards making it very time-consuming to write and has to be precise.

**4. What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need?**

Every HTML page needs a: 
1) Doctype page – will tell the processor what type of HTML doc it is. 
2) Roots – contain elements for the page and define them 
3) Head – has the elements that are going to link to other files or hold important info. The head will also contain the ‘title’ tag for the page
4) Body – contains all other content of a page, such as data that we will see and interact with 

**5. What is the index.html page for? Where does it go?**

The index.html page is going to be the homepage for the website the HTML is referring to. The index.html page will always go to the top level of a directory.

**6. Review: What are some of the best naming practices?**

Naming practices are important for keeping folders and documents organized and easy to read by websites that are being designed. It is best to create a main root folder that contains all information for your site tucked into it neatly. Keep all file names short, simple, and easy to follow as many will also be displayed in the URL and directory paths. Lastly, try not to make to many folders within folders that will be hard to follow or create long and slow URLs/paths.
